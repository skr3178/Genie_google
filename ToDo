- Error accumulation in training models
- Genie uses much smaller context window - 16 - how to reduce it?
- compare loss term and comparison with the paper
- Metrics: 1.  Frechet Video Distance(FVD) 2. peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)
- Tokenizer is working properly - checked

- Since the Latent Action Model (LAM), is able to be run on with 176.2M params without calling OOM errors, it should be scaled up to with a much larger model and then we get more spread on Codebook utilization and action DIstribution balance

- the recontruction is not working too well (/media/skr/storage/robot_world/Genie/Genie_SKR/evaluations/lam/visual_eval_step_10000.mp4)
